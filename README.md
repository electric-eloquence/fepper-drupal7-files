# Fepper for Drupal 7

Fepper for Drupal 7 includes templates generated by the Fepper frontend 
prototyper as well as styles, scripts, and theme functions which build out the 
Drupal theme to match the look and feel of the Fepper frontend.

The documentation for Fepper for Drupal 7 does not vary from the documentation 
for [Fepper for Drupal 8](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal). 
As such, there does not exist justification to maintain a separate Fepper 
project for Drupal 7. Instead, populate your Fepper for Drupal 8 project with 
Drupal 7 patterns: 

* Download the latest release of [Fepper for Drupal 8](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal/releases).
* Download the latest release of [Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal).
* Change the name of the unpacked directory to `drupal`.
* Replace `backend/drupal` in Fepper for Drupal 8 with the unpacked directory.
* Replace `pref.yml` in Fepper for Drupal 8 with `pref.yml` from this repository.
* Replace `source` in Fepper for Drupal 8 with `source` from this repository.

If you wish to replicate the look and feel of the Fepper demo site (as per the 
screenshot) in your Drupal 7 backend, follow these instructions:

* Replace `backend/drupal/sites/default/files` in Fepper for Drupal 8 with the 
  `files` directory from this repository.
* Download and enable the [Views module](https://www.drupal.org/project/views).
* Restore `fepper-drupal-mysqldump.sql` into your MySQL database.
* Update the `$databases` settings in `backend/drupal/sites/default/settings.php` 
  to reflect your own database settings.
* Configure `d7.local` to be the hostname in your web server configs.
* Configure `backend/drupal` (correctly pathed) to be the document root for this 
  host.
* Restart the web server.
* Open http://d7.local in a browser.
* Log into Drupal with `admin:admin`
