# Fepper for Drupal 7

Fepper for Drupal 7 includes templates generated by the Fepper frontend 
prototyper as well as styles, scripts, and theme functions which build out the 
Drupal theme to match the look and feel of the Fepper frontend.

The documentation for this project does not vary from the documentation for 
[Fepper for Drupal 8](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal). As 
such, there does not exist justification to maintain a separate Fepper project 
for Drupal 7. Instead, populate your Fepper for Drupal 8 instance with Drupal 7 
patterns: 

* First, download [Fepper for Drupal 8](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal/releases).
* Then, copy `source` from this repository over `source` in your Fepper for Drupal 8 instance.

If you wish to replicate the look and feel of the Fepper demo site (as per the 
screenshot) in your Drupal 7 instance, follow these instructions on these files:

* `fepper-drupal-mysqldump.sql` - Restore into your MySQL database.
* `files` - Copy over `backend/drupal/sites/default/files`
