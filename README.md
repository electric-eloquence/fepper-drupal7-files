# Fepper for Drupal 7

Fepper for Drupal 7 includes templates generated by the Fepper frontend 
prototyper as well as styles, scripts, and theme functions which build out the 
Drupal theme to match the look and feel of the Fepper frontend.

The documentation for Fepper for Drupal 7 does not vary from the documentation 
for [Fepper for Drupal 8](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal). 
As such, there does not exist justification to maintain a separate Fepper 
project for Drupal 7. Instead, populate your Fepper for Drupal 8 project with 
Drupal 7 patterns: 

* Download the latest release of [Fepper for Drupal 8](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal/releases).
* Copy the `source` directory from this repository over the `source` directory 
  in Fepper for Drupal 8.

If you wish to replicate the look and feel of the Fepper demo site (as per the 
screenshot) in your Drupal 7 backend, you will need to download and enable the 
[Views module](https://www.drupal.org/project/views).

Then, follow these instructions on these files:

* `fepper-drupal-mysqldump.sql` - Restore into your MySQL database.
* `files` - Copy over `backend/drupal/sites/default/files`
