# Fepper for Drupal 7

Fepper for Drupal 7 includes templates generated by the Fepper frontend 
prototyper as well as styles, scripts, and theme functions which build out the 
Drupal theme to match the look and feel of the Fepper frontend.

The documentation for Fepper for Drupal 7 does not vary from the documentation 
for [Fepper for Drupal 8](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal). 
As such, there does not exist justification to maintain a separate Fepper 
project for Drupal 7. Instead, populate your Fepper for Drupal 8 project with 
the Drupal 7 backend and patterns: 

* Download the latest release of [Fepper for Drupal 8](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal/releases).
* Download the latest release of [Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal).
* Unpack the Drupal 7 download.
* Change the name of the unpacked directory to `drupal`
* Replace `backend/drupal` in Fepper for Drupal 8 with the unpacked directory.
* Replace `fepper-drupal-mysqldump.sql` in Fepper for Drupal 8 with 
  `fepper-drupal-mysqldump.sql` from this repository.
* Replace `pref.yml` in Fepper for Drupal 8 with `pref.yml` from this repository.
* Replace `source` in Fepper for Drupal 8 with `source` from this repository.
* Copy `fepper` from this repository to `backend/drupal/sites/all/themes`.

If you wish to replicate the look and feel of the Fepper demo site (as per the 
screenshot) in your Drupal 7 backend, follow these instructions:

* Configure `d7.local` to be the hostname in your web server configs.
* Configure `backend/drupal` (correctly pathed) to be the document root for this 
  host.
* Restart the web server.
* Create a MySQL database.
* Create a `settings.php` file by running the 
  [Drupal 7 installation script](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/installing-drupal-7/step-4-run-the-installation-script).
* Download and enable the [Views module](https://www.drupal.org/project/views).
* Replace `backend/drupal/sites/default/files` in Fepper for Drupal 8 with the 
  `files` directory from this repository.
* Restore `fepper-drupal-mysqldump.sql` into your MySQL database.
* Open http://d7.local in a browser.
* Log into Drupal with `admin:admin`
